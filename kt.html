            This software is a JavaFx application, designed and implemented with multi-thread graph search algorithms for solving the
            ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">Knight's tour puzzle</a>. A deployed desktop stand-alone version 
            is available for Mac OS X. Download <a href="KnightsTour/Knight's Tour.dmg">HERE</a> (.dmg file). 
              Source code is <a href="https://github.com/SeanJia/KnightsTourSolver/">HERE</a>, and you can also run it from the command line.

            Furthermore, owing to the extremely large quantity of computation needed for finding the knight&apos;s
            tour, some of the starting position might take around 2 minutes to receive results. Based on my test
            on a standard MacBook Air, by using this software, most of the solutions can be obtained within
            several seconds. Good luck and enjoy!
